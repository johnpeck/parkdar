* <2011-12-30 Fri> Created this project.
* <2012-01-01 Sun> Created minicom configuration.
  - As long as the FTDI dongle enumerates as /dev/ttyUSB0, simply starting minicom with "minicom parkdar" will bring up the terminal with all the right settings.  I had to configure minicom as root to set this configuration.


* TODO Change references to LED in the code
  - The LED is now at PB6. The idea was that I'll never use OC1B.
  - Also update the drawing to point to where LED goes.
